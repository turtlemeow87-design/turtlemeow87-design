# Hi, I'm Hunter (Todd) 👋

I'm an entry-level QA Tester with hands-on experience testing APIs and web applications across development, staging, and production environments. I'm actively looking for a QA position where I can do solid, reliable work and grow alongside a team.

## 🧪 My Testing Approach

Good QA starts before a single test is run — with understanding requirements and anticipating what could go wrong. My general workflow:

1. **Plan** — Define objectives, scope, and environment assumptions
2. **Design** — Write structured test cases mapped to requirements
3. **Execute** — Run tests, log results, document bugs with clear reproduction steps
4. **Validate** — Confirm fixes and check for regressions

I think of QA as a mindset as much as a skillset. I stay curious, ask questions early, and try to understand *why* something should work before testing whether it does. I'm also committed to continuous learning — the tools and practices in QA evolve constantly, and I think adapting to that is just part of the job.

## 📁 Featured Project

### [tradscendence-site](https://github.com/turtlemeow87-design/tradscendence-site)
A full-stack music booking website I built and use as a hands-on QA testing platform.

**What I tested:**
- Contact form inputs — required fields, edge cases, and multi-select behavior
- API endpoints via Postman — basic happy path and error response validation
- Form-to-database flow (submission → API route → PostgreSQL)
- Email delivery via Resend integration
- Behavior across development and production environments

**Documentation I created:**
- Structured test cases with expected vs. actual results
- Bug reports with steps to reproduce and resolution notes

This is a personal learning project — a real environment where I can practice QA workflows hands-on.
